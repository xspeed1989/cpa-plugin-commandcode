# cpa-plugin-commandcode

CLIProxyAPI native provider plugin for [commandcode.ai](https://api.commandcode.ai) (`api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1`).

CommandCode's OpenAI-compatible endpoint returns thinking text under `reasoning`
(string) and `reasoning_details[].text`, but never the standard
`reasoning_content` field. CLIProxyAPI's built-in openai→claude translator only
reads `reasoning_content`, so the field must be backfilled before translation.
For streaming `/v1/messages`, that translator also requires each OpenAI chunk
to arrive with an SSE `data: ` prefix; bare executor JSON is discarded.

This plugin implements a full provider (`ModelProvider + ModelRouter +
Executor + Request/Response translators`) that forwards chat-completions to
commandcode, normalizes responses into standard OpenAI shape, and applies the
route-specific transport framing expected by the host. This restores streaming
thinking, text, and usage on `/v1/messages` without modifying CLIProxyAPI.

## Capabilities

- `model_provider` — advertises the configured models under the
  `commandcode/` namespace (so they never collide with the native
  openai-compatibility channel; the ABI has no live `/v1/models` discovery).
- `model_router` — hijacks the configured client aliases (`deepseek-flash`,
  `deepseek-vision`, `glm-5.3-flash` by default) to this executor.
- `executor` — POSTs to `/chat/completions` through the host HTTP client
  (proxy policy + request-log preserved); backfills `reasoning_content` on
  every non-streaming response and every SSE data line, then applies the
  endpoint-specific stream framing described below.
- `request_translator` / `response_translator` — the same reasoning backfill
  for translated edges.

## Streaming compatibility

The host rewrites `ExecutorRequest.Format` and `SourceFormat` to the executor's
OpenAI format, so they cannot identify the original client endpoint. The
executor instead reads the host's public `request_path` metadata and prefixes a
normalized chunk with exactly one `data: ` only when its value is exactly
`/v1/messages`.

`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` remain bare: the Chat Completions
handler adds HTTP SSE framing itself, while the Responses translation accepts
bare executor chunks. Missing, non-string, unknown, or near-match paths also
remain bare (fail closed), preventing `data: data: {...}` output. The plugin
strips stacked upstream prefixes before applying this policy and leaves the
host responsible for terminal events and `[DONE]`.

Only the separately mounted plugin artifact needs updating. No custom
CLIProxyAPI image and no Compose, updater, configuration, or `.env` changes are
required; official host auto-updates remain compatible.

## Model mapping

The plugin runs its own executor against `api.commandcode.ai`, so the host's
`openai-compatibility` alias table does not apply to its requests. commandcode
only accepts fully-qualified vendor names, and rejects a bare alias with
`Model "deepseek-flash" is not supported on this endpoint` — so the mapping has
to happen here.

Fields match the host's alias convention: `name` is what goes upstream,
`alias` is what clients send.

```yaml
    commandcode:
      models:
        - alias: deepseek-flash
          name: deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash
        - alias: glm-5.3-flash
          name: z-ai/glm-5.3-flash
          display_name: "GLM 5.3 Flash"     # optional label
```

When the vendor renames a model, edit this list — no code change. Omitting
`models` entirely uses the built-in defaults (those two entries).
An entry with no `name` claims the alias but forwards it verbatim, which is
only correct for aliases the host resolves itself.

## Install

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  configs:
    commandcode:
      enabled: true
      priority: 100
      api_keys:
        - key: user_YOUR_FIRST_KEY
          weight: 10
          proxy_url: http://127.0.0.1:18080   # optional per-key proxy
        - key: user_YOUR_SECOND_KEY
          weight: 5
          # disabled: true  # optional per-key kill switch (default false)
          # no proxy_url -> host HTTP client (host proxy policy + request-log)
```

Legacy single-key form (`api_key: user_...`) still works and equals a
one-member pool. Weighted-random selection per request; transport errors,
All non-2xx HTTP responses (including 400, 402 and 403), transport errors,
and stream read errors before the first normalized output chunk fail over to
the next member. Each request tries every enabled member at most once per
round, for up to **3 rounds**, waiting **1 second** before round 2 and
**2 seconds** before round 3. Two enabled keys therefore allow at most 6
attempts. Cancellation stops retries and backoff immediately; if all attempts
fail, the last error is returned. Once streaming output starts, errors are
forwarded without retrying, to avoid duplicate output or tool calls.

Invalid requests also retry, which can increase latency; ambiguous transport
failures may cause duplicate upstream processing or billing. Members with `proxy_url`
(http/https/socks5) use a self-built transport — host request-log cannot
capture those outbound calls. Members with `disabled: true` are excluded
from selection without deleting them; disabling every defined member fails
closed (no silent fallback to the legacy key). Toggling takes effect on
plugin reconfigure/restart, no rebuild needed.

On the ModelRouter path the host passes a nil auth to the executor, so the
key **must** come from `plugins.configs.commandcode.api_keys` (or legacy
`api_key`). Then restart:

```bash
docker restart cli-proxy-api
docker logs cli-proxy-api | grep commandcode
# pluginhost: plugin registered plugin_id=commandcode plugin_name=CommandCode Provider
```

Optional overrides:

```yaml
    commandcode:
      # Default: the three mappings shown under "Model mapping".
      models:
        - alias: my-alias
          name: vendor/model-name
      base_url: https://mirror.example.com/provider/v1    # default: https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1
```


## Build

Debian/glibc toolchain only (the runtime image is Debian; musl `.so` fails
to `dlopen`). Requires Go >= 1.26:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Runs `go vet`, `go test`, then `go build -buildmode=c-shared` for
`./cmd/commandcode`, emitting `commandcode-v<version>.so` into
`plugins/linux/amd64/`. The build injects the same version into the plugin's ABI
registration metadata; the default artifact and metadata version is `0.3.3`.

## Test

```bash
go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

Covers the reasoning backfill (details-array priority, plain-string
fallback, existing-`reasoning_content` passthrough), SSE buffering and
normalization (split reads, stacked `data:` collapse, malformed/control-line
filtering, `[DONE]` swallowing), exact-path framing policy, error/cancellation
propagation, alias→upstream model mapping, and router ownership.

## Release

1. `./build.sh` (or `PLUGIN_VERSION=x.y.z ./build.sh`).
2. Package `commandcode_<version>_<goos>_<goarch>.zip` files with the
   library at the zip root (Linux: `commandcode.so`, Darwin:
   `commandcode.dylib`, Windows: `commandcode.dll`).
3. Generate `checksums.txt` (sha256 of the zips).
4. `gh release create v<version> *.zip checksums.txt`
